      <p>
        Marina Bay Sands, a waterfront resort, is one of the most recognizable
        and photographed buildings in Singapore. <br />
        The massive complex includes a hotel, museum, a 74,000-square-meter
        shopping center, theaters and galleries, and <br />
        a Skypark with an infinity pool and a rooftop garden overlooking the
        bay.

      <p>
        Just 12 kilometers from the heart of Singapore and sitting on the slopes
        of Bukit Timah Hill, <br />
        this tiny 1.64-square-kilometer park is covered in rainforest and home
        to over 500 animal species <br />â€“ including the reticulated python,
        crab-eating macaques, and the rare red-crowned barbet bird. <br />
        Tropical ferns and dense jungle surround the many hiking trails here,
        and the reserve also offers rock <br />
        climbing and abseiling (rappelling) opportunities, as well as mountain
        bike trails.
